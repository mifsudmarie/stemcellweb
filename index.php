							<p style="color:#0B0062;font-size:18px">De Novo Cell ltd is a University of Malta spinout registered in Malta, with ownership shared between the inventors, Dr Pierre Schembri Wismayer and Dr Ila Tewari Jasra, and the University of Malta. The company plans to research further sources of blood which will result in protectable intellectual property of extremely high value. <br><br>
								At this stage the company is licensing the technology relating to the chemical induction of cord blood into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to the Research Market. This includes licensing the technology for the production of kits to assist scientists with all of the tools necessary to carry out their research. <br><br>
								Further on in the pipeline, the company will develop the technology to include peripheral blood and urine cells as a source. It will also carry out development to infiltrate the clinical market in specific areas with the aim to develop future stem cell therapeutics.</p></span>

Apart from that, the agents required for conversion are cheap and very readily available, only requiring repurposing.
							<br><br> This method is also being extended to include peripheral blood cells and will be further tested on fibroblasts. Developing a similarly successful rate of conversion will help to massively enhance the potential benefits due to being able to make these cells easily from any adult. </p>

							<p style="color:#0B0062;font-size:18px">	iPSCs could provide rapid availability of cells derived from each individual to produce any tissue types needed even possibly in advance, for prophylaxis. These cells would be the patientâ€™s own cells, thus avoiding both rejection as well as dangerous immune invisibility.  The rapid development at low cost would make these cells viable both as widespread therapeutics as well as for scientific use, experimentation and research purposes.
							<br><br> This brings the idea of personalised induced pluripotent stem cells into the realm of general public, for present or future regenerative medicine possibilities, which could target diseases such as Parkinsons disease, kidney disease and heart failure to name a few.

										<p class="mb-5"; style="font-size:18px">Prof Pierre Schembri-Wismayer qualified as a medical doctor from the University of Malta in 1991. He then pursued his PhD in Molecular and
Cellular Oncology, at the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research in affiliation
with Glasgow University in the UK.
He is presently Associate Professor at the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery and teaches Clinical and Applied Anatomy as well as Cell Biology. <BR> <br>
His departmental research includes developing novel methods of
immunotherapy and virotherapy as well as malignant cell differentiation as
cancer therapeutics. He has developed new methods of producing induced
pluripotent stem cells together with Dr Ila Tewari. He has a strong
interest in anatomical biomechanics, and has developed a totally novel hip joint
prosthesis design in collaboration with Engineering colleagues. This has been
patented, as have been other medical devices involved in surgery, both
orthopedic and general.</p>
